# Exploratory_Data_Analysis

## Introduction
This assignment uses data from the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository</a>, a popular repository for machine learning datasets. In particular, we will be using the "Individual household electric power consumption Data Set" which I have made available on the course web site:
* <b>Dataset</b>: <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip">Electric power consumption</a> [20Mb]
* <b>Description</b>: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.

The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption">UCI web site</a>:
<ol>
<li><b>Date</b>: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy </li>
<li><b>Time</b>: time in format hh:mm:ss </li>
<li><b>Global_active_power</b>: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt) </li>
<li><b>Global_reactive_power</b>: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt) </li>
<li><b>Voltage</b>: minute-averaged voltage (in volt) </li>
<li><b>Global_intensity</b>: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere) </li>
<li><b>Sub_metering_1</b>: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered). </li>
<li><b>Sub_metering_2</b>: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light. </li>
<li><b>Sub_metering_3</b>: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.</li>
</ol>

## Making Plots
Overall goal here is simply to examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007.

For each plot following is done
* Each plot is a PNG file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.
* Each of the plot files are named `plot1.png`, `plot2.png`, etc.
* Separate R code file (`plot1.R`, `plot2.R`, etc.) that constructs the corresponding plot, i.e. code in `plot1.R` constructs the `plot1.png` plot. R files **includes code for reading the data** so that the plot can be fully reproduced.
* the PNG file and R code file to your git repository

Git repository is pushed to GitHub. There are four PNG files and four R code files.
The four plots reconstructed are shown below. 

### Plot 1

### Plot 2
[plot2.R](plot2.R)

### Plot 3
